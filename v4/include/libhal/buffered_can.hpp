 * @deprecated This interface has too much responsibility and has been split up

 * @brief Controller Area Network (CAN bus) hardware abstraction interface with
 * message buffering.
 *
 * Buffered can provides easy access to all can messages received by the CAN bus
 * allowing multiple device drivers to use the same buffered can for their
 * operations.
 *
 * This interface does not provide APIs for CAN message hardware filtering. The
 * hardware implementation for CAN message filter varies wildly across devices
 * and thus a common API is infeasible. So we rely on the concrete classes, the
 * implementations of this interface to provide APIs for setting the CAN filter
 * for the specific hardware. Hardware filtering is a best effort with the
 * resources available. It is often not possible to filter every possible ID in
 * hardware that your application is interested in. Thus, must expect that the
 * CAN message receive buffer.
 *
 * All implementations MUST allow the user to supply their own message buffer of
 * arbitrary size up to the limits of what hardware can support. This allows a
 * developer the ability to tailored the buffer size to the needs of the
 * application.
 *
 * All CAN messages that pass through the hardware filter will be added to the,
 * message circular buffer.

   *   auto new_head = port.receive_cursor();
   *   // Account for circular wraparound when calculating messages received

   * The data between your last saved position and the current head position
