/**
 * @brief Hardware abstraction interface for a steady clock mechanism
 *
 * Implementations of this interface must follow the same requirements as a
 * std::chrono::steady_clock, in that the clock is monotonic & steady. An
 * additional requirement is added to ensure that the clock is reliable. Meaning
 * calls to the interface functions do not return errors because this clock
 * should be infallible. To ensure this, this clock should be driven by the
 * platform's peripheral drivers or some other mechanism that is unlikely to go
 * offline while the platform is in a normal operating state.
 *
 * This clock is steady meaning that subsequent calls to get the uptime of this
 * clock cannot decrease as physical time moves forward and the time between
 * ticks of this clock are constant and defined by the clock's frequency.
 *
 * This can be used to get the time since the boot up, or to be more accurate,
 * the time when the steady clock object is created. This clock is most suitable
 * for measuring time intervals.
 *
 * After creation of this clock, the operating frequency shall not change.
