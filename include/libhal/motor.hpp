   * @brief Apply power to the motor
   *
   * Power is a percentage and thus cannot be used as a way to gauge how fast
   * the motor is moving. In general applying more power means to increase speed
   * and/or torque to the motor.
   *
   * - 0% power would mean that no power is being applied to the motor. In this
   *   situation an unloaded motor will not move. 0% power does not guarantee
   *   that the motor will hold its position. These specifics depend greatly on
   *   the type of motor used and careful selection of motor and motor driver
   *   are important for applications using this interface.
   *
   * - 100% power means that the maximum available of power is being applied to
   *   the motor. As an example, if the max voltage of a DC brushed motor's
   *   power supply is 12V, then 12V would be supplied to this motor.
   *
   * - 50% power would mean that half of the available power is being applied to
   *   the motor. Using the same example, in this case 6V would be applied to
   *   the motor either as a DC constant voltage or via PWM at 50% duty cycle.
   *
   * - Negative values will cause the motor to move in the opposite
   *   direction as positive values. In the event that motor driver can *
   *   only go in one direction, this function should clamp the power applied to
   *   0%.
   *
   * @param p_power - Percentage of power to apply to the motor from -1.0f to
   * +1.0f, -100% to 100%, respectively.
   * @return result<power_t> - success or failure
