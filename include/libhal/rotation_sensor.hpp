/**
 * @brief Rotation measuring hardware abstraction interface
 *
 * Examples of rotary encoder are:
 *
 *    - Rotary Potentiometers
 *    - Quadrature Encoders
 *    - Incremental Encoders
 *    - Absolute Encoders
 *    - Rotary Magnetic Encoders
 *    - Inertial Measurement Unit or IMU
 *
 * Rotation sensors can be relative or absolute. Relative position means that
 * the sensor can only see changes in rotation from where measurement started.
 * In other words, at application start, relative encoders will start at 0.
 * Absolute encoders know their position at all times. At application start, the
 * absolute encoder will be able to determine its exact orientation relative to
 * a frame of reference when read.
 *
 * Examples of relative rotation sensors are:
 *
 *    - Quadrature Encoders
 *    - Incremental Encoders
 *
 * Examples of absolute rotation sensors are:
 *
 *    - Rotary Potentiometers
 *    - Absolute Encoders
 *    - Rotary Magnetic Encoders
 *    - IMUs
 *
 * Rotation sensors can also be finite or infinite. Finite meaning that the
 * angle that can be reported is a fixed amount for the device. Infinite means
 * that the encoder can continue rotating and adding more to its angle reading
 * forever. Infinite rotation sensors tend to not have a physical stop that
 * limits how much they can be rotated.
 *
 * Examples of finite rotation sensors are:
 *
 *    - Rotary Potentiometers
 *    - Absolute Encoders
 *    - IMUs
 *
 * Examples of infinite rotation sensors are:
 *
 *    - Rotary Magnetic Encoders
 *    - Quadrature Encoders
 *    - Incremental Encoders
 *
 * This interface does not provide a means to determine these attributes of a
 * rotation sensor as this is an application architecture decision. Drivers that
 * implement this interface should document what kind of rotary sensor it is
 * such that a developer can determine its applicability to their application.
 * The context of which sensor ought to be used for an application is solely
 * known at architecture definition time and software should not be expected to
 * at runtime, if the right type of rotation sensor was passed into the object.
