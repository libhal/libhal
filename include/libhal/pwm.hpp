   * a pwm channel is grouped with a pwm manager is hardware specific. Consult
   * the implementation for more details regarding which channels are effected
   * by each pwm manager.

   * The pwm device may not be capable of providing the exact frequency passed
   * to this function. Implementations must perform a best-effort approximation
   * given their input clocks. If software requires the frequency to be within a
   * specific range, then the `hal::pwm_channel::frequency()` should be called
   * to verify that the frequency is within specification.
   *
   * Implementations must ensure that, after frequency modification that the
   * duty cycles of channels managed by this driver remains approximately the
   * same. If the frequency is changed from 1kHz to 2kHz and the duty cycle for
   * a pwm channel under this manager is 50%, then the duty cycle must remain in
   * ~50% up to the limits that the hardware can provide. In the case where a
   * choosen frequency results in reduced duty cycle precision, the
   * implementation is allowed to reduce duty cycle precision for all pwm
   * channels under its management.
   *
   * Implementations are not guaranteed to ensure a smooth transition from one
   * frequency to the next. Software should be designed around the idea that
   * modifying the PWM frequency while pwm channels are active can cause their
   * duty cycle to be disrupted for a few cycles.

 * effect another pwm object. This interface also uses floats for pwm duty cycle
