/**
 * @brief Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) channel hardware abstraction.
 *
 * This driver controls the waveform generation of a square wave and its
 * properties such as frequency and duty cycle.
 *
 * Frequency, meaning how often the waveform cycles from from low to high.
 *
 * Duty cycle, what proportion of the wavelength of the pulse is the voltage
 * HIGH.
 *
 *  ```

 *    |<------ high ------>|<low>|
 *
 *    HIGH Duration = 18 segments
 *    LOW Duration =  5 segments
 *    Duty Cycle = 20 / (20 + 5) = 80%
 *
 *    If each segment is 1us then the wavelength is 25us
 *    Thus frequency is (1 / 25us) = 40kHz
 * ```
 *
 * PWM is used for power control like motor control, lighting, transmitting
 * signals to servos, sending telemetry and much more.
