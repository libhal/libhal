   * @brief perform an i2c transaction with another device on the bus. The type

   * block until the entire transfer is finished.
   *
   * Performing Write, Read and Write-Then-Read transactions depends on which
   * span for data_out and data_in are set to null.
   *
   * - For write transactions, pass p_data_in as an empty span
   * `std::span<hal::byte>{}` and pass a buffer to p_data_out.
   *
   * - For read transactions, pass p_data_out as an empty span
   * `std::span<const hal::byte>{}` and pass a buffer to p_data_in.
   *
   * - For write-then-read transactions, pass a buffer for both p_data_in
   *   p_data_out.
   *
   * - If both p_data_in and p_data_out are empty, simply do nothing and return
   *   success.
   *
   * In the event of arbitration loss, this function will wait for the bus to
   * become free and try again. Arbitration loss means that during the address
   * phase of a transaction 1 or more i2c bus controllers attempted to perform
   * an transaction and one of the i2c bus controllers, that isn't this one won
   * out.
   *
   * @param p_address 7-bit address of the device you want to communicate with.
   * To perform a transaction with a 10-bit address, this parameter must be the
   * address upper byte of the 10-bit address OR'd with 0b1111'0000 (the 10-bit
   * address indicator). The lower byte of the address must be contained in the
   * first byte of the p_data_out span.
   * @param p_data_out data to be written to the addressed device. Set to
   * nullptr with length zero in order to skip writing.
   * @param p_data_in buffer to store read data from the addressed device. Set
   * to nullptr with length 0 in order to skip reading.
   * @param p_timeout callable which notifies the i2c driver that it has run out
   * of time to perform the transaction and must stop and return control to the
   * caller.
   * @throws hal::timed_out from p_timeout if the transaction exceeds its
   * deadline.
   * @throws hal::no_such_device - indicates that no devices on
   * the bus acknowledge the address in this transaction, which could mean that
   * the device is not connected to the bus, is not powered, not available to
   * respond, broken or many other possible outcomes.
   * @throws hal::resource_unavailable_try_again - if there is another
   * controller on the bus and it won control of the bus, this transaction is
   * canceled and this exception is thrown.
   * @throws hal::io_error - indicates that the i2c lines were put into an
   * invalid state during the transaction due to interference, misconfiguration,
   * hardware fault, malfunctioning i2c peripheral or possibly something else.
   * This tends to present a hardware issue and is usually not recoverable.
