# libhal/experimental

This directory is meant for experimental interfaces and libraries. Anything in
this directory can change between versions. Unlike other libraries, the API or
ABI may break for something in the experimental library and only the minor
number is incremented. Do not trust or depend on anything within this
directory. Wait for the contents of this directory to be moved the the mainline
libhal include directory before depending on the files.
