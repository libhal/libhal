     *   - Sync Segment (always 1qt): Initial sync transition, the start of a
     *     CAN bit.
     *   - Propagation Delay (1qt ... 8qt): Number of time quanta to
     *     compensate for signal/propagation delays across the network.
     *   - Phase Segment 1 (1qt ... 8qt): phase segment 1 acts as a buffer that
     *     can be lengthened to resynchronize with the bit stream via the
     *     synchronization jump width.
     *   - Phase Segment 2 (1qt ... 8qt): Occurs after the sampling point. Phase
     *     segment 2. can be shortened to resynchronize with the bit stream via
     *     the synchronization jump width.
     *   - Synchronization jump width (1qt ... 4qt): This is the maximum time by
     *     which the bit sampling period may be lengthened or shortened during
     *     each cycle to adjust for oscillator mismatch between nodes. This
     *     value must be smaller than phase_segment1 and phase_segment2.
     *
     * The exact value of these segments is calculated for you by the can
     * peripheral based on the input clock to the peripheral and the desired
     * baud rate.
     *
     * A conformant can bus peripheral driver will either choose from tq
     * starting from 25 and reducing it down to 8 or will have pre-configured
     * timing values for each frequency it supports.
