/**
 * @brief Hardware abstract interface for the serial communication protocol
 *
 * Use this interface for hardware that implements a serial protocol like UART,
 * RS232, RS485 and others that use a similar communication protocol but may use
 * different voltage schemes.
 *
 * This interface only works 8-bit serial data frames.
 *
 * Due to the asynchronous and unformatted nature of serial communication
 * protocols, all implementations of serial devices must be buffered. Buffered,
 * in this case, is defined as automatic storage of received bytes without
 * direct application intervention.
 *
 * All implementations MUST allow the user to supply their own buffer of
 * arbitrary size up to the limits of what hardware can support. This allows a
 * developer the ability to tailored the buffer size to the needs of the
 * application.
 *
 * Examples of buffering schemes are:
 *
 * - Using DMA to copy data from a serial peripheral to a region of memory
 * - Using interrupts when a serial peripheral's queue has filled to a point.
 *   Refrain from using interrupts if the peripheral's byte queue is only of
 *   size 1. This is bad for runtime performance and can result in missed bytes.

  /**
   * @brief Returns the current write position of the circular receive buffer
   *
   * Receive head represents the position where the next byte of data will be
   * written in to the receive buffer. This position advances as new data
   * arrives. To determine how much new data has arrived, store the previous
   * head position and compare it with the current head position, accounting for
   * buffer wraparound.
   *
   * The cursor value will ALWAYS follow this equation:
   *
   *          0 <= cursor && cursor < receive_buffer().size()
   *
   * Thus making the following expression valid memory access:
   *
   *         serial.receive_buffer()[ serial.cursor() ];
   *
   * Just note that just because it is valid does not mean that there is useful
   * information at this position.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *   auto old_head = port.receive_head();
   *   // ... wait for new data ...
   *   auto new_head = port.receive_head();
   *   // Account for circular wraparound when calculating bytes received
   *   auto buffer_size = port.receive_buffer().size();
   *   auto bytes_received = (new_head + buffer_size - old_head) % buffer_size;
   *
   * Use this along with receive_buffer() to access newly received data. The
   * data between your last saved position and the current head position
   * represents the newly received bytes. When reading the data, remember that
   * it may wrap around from the end of the buffer back to the beginning.
   *
   * @return std::size_t - position of the write cursor for the circular buffer
