/**
 * @brief Hardware abstract interface for the serial communication protocol
 *
 * Use this interface for hardware that implements a serial protocol like UART,
 * RS232, RS485 and others that use a similar communication protocol but may use
 * different voltage schemes.
 *
 * This interface only works 8-bit serial data frames.
 *
 * Due to the asynchronous and unformatted nature of serial communication
 * protocols, all implementations of serial devices must be buffered. Buffered,
 * in this case, is defined as automatic storage of received bytes without
 * direct application intervention.
 *
 * All implementations MUST allow the user to supply their own buffer of
 * arbitrary size up to the limits of what hardware can support. This allows a
 * developer the ability to tailored the buffer size to the needs of the
 * application.
 *
 * Examples of buffering schemes are:
 *
 * - Using DMA to copy data from a serial peripheral to a region of memory
 * - Using interrupts when a serial peripheral's queue has filled to a point
 *
