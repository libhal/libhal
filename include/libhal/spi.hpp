/**
 * @brief Serial peripheral interface (SPI) communication protocol hardware
 * abstraction interface for individual channels
 *
 * This interface supports the most common SPI features:
 *
 * 1. Word length locked to 8-bits
 * 2. Byte transfer is always MSB first
 *
 * # Design Philosophy
 *
 * By restricting the SPI interface requirements, we ensure compatibility with
 * nearly all devices that communicate over SPI. This approach simplifies both
 * the requirements and the code for SPI drivers and implementations.
 *
 * ## 8-bit Transfers
 *
 * The 8-bit word length is the most common SPI word length, compatible with
 * almost any SPI peripheral driver, SPI converter driver, and most devices.
 * Devices that support 16-bit word transfers can split the 16-bit word into two
 * bytes. Devices using word formats that aren't multiples of 8 bits are very
 * rare.
 *
 * ## MSB First Transfers
 *
 * The most common bit order for SPI is MSB first. Devices that use LSB first
 * are rare. Drivers using this SPI interface must handle bit reversal to
 * comply with the MSB first requirement. This decision helps to eliminate
 * rare and potentially unsupportable configurations, optimizing the interface
 * for the majority of use cases.
 *
 * ## Manual Chip Select as Bus Access Control
 *
 * Many SPI peripherals have a dedicated chip select pin that can be controlled
 * automatically. Automatic chip select control asserts the chip
 * select for the duration of the transfer and de-asserts it at the end, which
 * can be problematic for drivers needing to perform multiple transfers while
 * keeping the chip select asserted. For instance, if there are components of a
 * payload in read-only memory that are not contiguous, the driver or
 * application would have to copy the contents of those components to a buffer
 * before a full transfer can occur. This requirement for a memory buffer equal
 * to the length of the whole transaction is wasteful and can be prohibitively
 * expensive in some applications.
 *
 * For example, like SD cards, require the chip select to be held with a
 * sequence of clock cycles until the SD card responds with actual data. The
 * number of cycles can vary, so manual chip select control allows more precise
 * and  memory-efficient operations.
 *
 * ## Chip Select as Bus Access Control
 *
 * A single spi bus can communicate with different devices via a chip select
 * pin. The chip select pin acts like a binary decoder where only one output is
 * active at a time based on its inputs. It is important that two chip select
 * signals are not active at one time as this could cause bus contention where
 * multiple devices are attempting to communicate on the spi controller input
 * data line, known as CIPO (controller in, peripheral out) also known as MISO
 * (master in slave out).
 *
 * This interface mandates that spi channels utilizing the same physical spi bus
 * enforce bus mutual exclusion on that bus via the `chip_select()` API. The spi
 * channel can lock/acquire control over the spi bus with `chip_select(true)`
 * and releases control via `chip_select(false)`. See API documentation for more
 * details.
 *
 * ## Each channel remembers its configuration
 *
 * Each channel is mandated to remember its last configuration so that, when the
 * API `chip_select()` is called with value `true`, the spi bus is configured to
 * the last configuration passed to `configure()`. This allows each spi channels
 * to be configured to their use case. For example, a spi channel can be passed
 * to an SD card driver and operate at 12MHz whereas another spi channel can be
 * set to 1.2MHz to communicate with a sensor that can only handle speeds up
 * to 1.2MHz maximum.
 *

  /**
   * @brief Control both chip select & exclusive access to the spi bus

   * This API controls access over a shared spi bus and controls the state of
   * the channel's chip select voltage signal. When this API is called with the
   * value `true`, this function returns when the spi channel gains exclusive
   * control over the spi bus. Implementation must do the following:
   *
   * 1. Wait until the bus is no longer currently in use. This happens when
   *    another `spi_channel` object that uses the same spi bus is currently
   *    using the bus.
   * 2. Acquire exclusive access over the bus in such a way that other
   *    `spi_channel` objects using the same underlying spi are blocked until
   *    the bus is available.
   * 3. Configure spi bus to the settings of this spi channel.
   * 3. Assert the chip select signal. libhal considers "chip select" as
   *    negative polarity meaning that a LOW voltage is required to assert them.
   *    If the chip select is driven by a `hal::output_pin` then call the API
   *    `hal::output_pin::level(false)` should be called to assert the chip
   *    select.
   * 4. Return
   *
   * Implementations are encouraged to use a `hal::basic_lock` for steps 1
   * and 2.
   *
   * If this API is called with the value `false` and exclusive access has been
   * granted over the bus, then following should occur:
   *
   * 1. De-assert chip select signal. If the chip select is driven by a
   *    `hal::output_pin` then call the API `hal::output_pin::level(true)`
   *    should be called to assert the chip select.
   * 2. Release access to the bus. If a `hal::basic_lock` is used, then call the
   *    `hal::basic_lock::unlock()` API.
   *
   * If exclusive access has not been granted over the bus and this is called
   * with the value `false`, then nothing should occur. Implementations can
   * utilize a boolean variable or the state of their chip select to determine
   * if the bus previously acquired.
   *
   * Notice that there is no step to configure the spi bus on de-assertion. This
   * is because configuration should only occur during bus acquisition. There is
   * no need to perform work twice.
   *
   * On construction, the chip select state should be as if this API was called
   * with `false`.
   *
   * @param p_select - if set to true will acquire exclusive access to the spi
   * bus and asserts chip select. If another channel already has exclusive
   * access over the spi bus, then this function waits until access is made
   * available. Implementations are encouraged to utilize `hal::io_waiter` for
   * this. When set to false, releases exclusive control over the bus and
   * de-asserts chip select.
