   * @brief Set the position of the servo's output shaft
   *
   * Position is the rotational position as a angle in degrees that the caller
   * wants the shaft to rotate to. The allowed range of positions is defined by
   * the servo itself. Many servos have intrinsic limits to their range.
   *
   * Developers must choose servos that fit the range for their applications.
   * Applications must clearly define the range that they require in order to
   * perform correctly.
   *
   * The velocity in which the servo shaft moves is not defined by this function
   * but is either intrinsic to the servo or a configuration of the servo.
   *
   * @param p_position - the position to move the servo shaft in degrees.
   * @throws hal::argument_out_of_domain - when position exceeds the range of
   * the servo. When this error occurs, the guaranteed behavior is that the
   * servo keeps its last set position.
