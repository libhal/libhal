The foundation of the libhal ecosystem, containing the core hardware interfaces
used to make the whole ecosystem work.

## ðŸ“š Software APIs & Usage

To learn about the available drivers and APIs see the
[API Reference](https://libhal.github.io/api/namespacehal/)
documentation page or look at the
[`include/libhal`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal/tree/main/include/libhal)
directory.

## ðŸ§° Setup

Following the
[ðŸš€ Getting Started](https://libhal.github.io/getting_started/)
instructions.

## ðŸ“¦ Adding `libhal` to your project

This section assumes you are using the
[`libhal-starter`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal-starter)
project.

Add the following to your `requirements()` method to the `ConanFile` class:

```python
    def requirements(self):
          self.requires("libhal/[^4.0.0]", transitive_headers=True)
```

The version number can be changed to whatever is appropriate for your
application. If you don't know, using the latest is usually a good choice.

Normally, this is not done, as usually libhal is into the code base via
implementation libraries such `libhal-lpc40` and `libhal-stm32f1` for
peripheral drivers, or, `libhal-esp8266` and `libhal-mpu` for device drivers.
